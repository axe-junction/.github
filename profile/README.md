# AXE Server - Smart Transportation & Mobility Platform

**AXE Server** is a high-performance, microservices-based transportation platform designed to transform mobility in Algeria. It intelligently integrates **public transport (bus, metro, train)** and **private ride-hailing (VTC)** services to deliver the **optimal route, time, and price** to users â€” all in real-time.

>  Powered by AI agents, OSRM, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and a rock-solid Go + Python backend.

---

##  Architecture Overview

AXE follows a modular microservices architecture with **clear domain separation**, high availability, and AI capabilities.

### Core Services

| Service         | Tech Stack                    | Purpose                                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|  Gateway      | Go, Fiber, OAuth 2.0, gRPC     | API Gateway, Auth, Routing orchestration |
|  Routing      | Go, OSRM, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL | Multi-modal journey planner            |
|  VTC          | Go, Kafka, Geocoding           | Ride-hailing & dynamic pricing         |
|  Data         | FastAPI, Agents         | AI-powered data collection & sync      |

## Service Breakdown

###  Gateway Service
- Built with **Go + Fiber**
- Handles **OAuth 2.0 login** (Google)
- Issues **JWT tokens** to secure access
- Uses **gRPC** to communicate with Routing and VTC services
- Aggregates multi-modal routes (Public + VTC)

**Key Endpoints:**
- `/auth/google`
- `/routes/best`
- `/vtc/prices`
- User management APIs

---

###  Routing Service
- Built with **Go + GORM**
- Integrates **OSRM** for road-based routing
- Supports **bus, tram, train, metro, private transport**
- Real-time updates via **RabbitMQ**

**Data Models:**
- `Stations`: With GPS and safety scores
- `Lines`: Public routes with fares/schedules
- `Stops`: Sequenced line stops
- `Journeys`: Optimized multi-transfer trips

**Key Features:**
- Route safety rating
- Dynamic fare calculation
- Public transport schedules
- Integration with Data Service for sync

---

###  VTC Service
- Built with **Go**
- Kafka-based **event-driven architecture**
- Dynamic pricing, geolocation, driver/passenger matching

**Key Features:**
- `getVtcPrices()` â€” surge-based real-time estimates
- Multi-provider integration
- Location-to-location time/distance estimation

---

###  Data Service (Multi-Agent AI)
- Built with **FastAPI + Python**
- **3 AI Agents**:
  - `ScraperAgent` â†’ Fetches raw transport data
  - `CleanerAgent` â†’ Normalizes and validates
  - `FinalizerAgent` â†’ Formats and stores in DB
- **Post-processing Diffing Algorithm** compares finalized output with database.
  - If changes detected â†’ emits sync event to Routing Service via RabbitMQ
  - Else â†’ No-op

##  Infrastructure & Tooling

| Layer             | Tech                         |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Messaging        | RabbitMQ (public), Kafka (VTC) |
| Databases        | PostgreSQL (shared schema)   |
| Auth             | OAuth 2.0 + JWT              |
| Containerization | Docker Compose               |
| Comm Protocols   | REST (clients), gRPC (internal), Webhooks |
| Orchestration    | Internal service discovery   |

---

## Business Logic Highlights

-  **AI-Powered Processing**: Clean, validate, and sync transport data in real-time.
-  **Multi-Modal Smart Routing**: Combines public + private transport options.
-  **Pricing Engine**: Compares public fares vs. VTC surge pricing.
-  **Real-Time Updates**: Station availability, delays, and new lines.
-  **Secure and Modular**: Authenticated API access with scalable microservices.
